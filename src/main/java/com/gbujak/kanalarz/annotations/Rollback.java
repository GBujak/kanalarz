 * Annotation for making a method the rollback for some step. Any params of a method
 * annotated with this must have the same name as some of the params of the rollforward
 * step - either by the param name in the code or by using the @Arg annotation.
 * The output of the rollforward param can be injected using the @RollforwardOut annotation.
 * <br>
 * Types and nullability are checked to be the same at the start of the spring context.
 * <br>
 * <b>If you store the steps in a database, make sure any changes to the rollback methods
 * are backwards-compatible, or you may need to fix the existing steps in a migration.
 * If you only want to change the param name you can use the @Arg annotation to preserve
 * backwards-compatibility. The order of the params doesn't matter.</b>
